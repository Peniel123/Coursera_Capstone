Today, more people than ever live in a country other than the one in which they were born. In 2019, the number of migrants globally reached an estimated 272 million, 51 million more than in 2010. International migrants comprise 3.5 per cent of the global population. Canada is aiming to add 401,000 new permanent residents next year and 411,000 in 2022. It is important that immigrants have a good understanding of Canada should they decide to migrate there. This project looks to throw more lit on Canada by looking at Toronto and comparing it to other cities of the world to understand its culture.
